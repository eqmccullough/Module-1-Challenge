# HTML Refactoring

I updated the html starter code to have semantic elements rather than non-semantic ones. Also, I added src attributes to any images as well as updated the title. All of this improves search engine optimization and user experience.

# CSS Refactoring

I consolidated classes and changed some class names to match the semantic elements in HTML. See comments in the CSS file.
